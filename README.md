This repo stores my solutions for the 2024 Advent of Code puzzles. Advent of Code can be found at [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com/).

These puzzles are for fun, and I solve them without the desire to write beautiful or clean code, and without feeling the need to comment my code, as I am the only one who is looking at it. 

If you are looking at this to consider hiring me for a programming job, please understand I have different standards for personal coding projects and professional work, and please ignore any hastily thrown together code and lack of clarification you may see.
